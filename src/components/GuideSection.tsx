              <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                Most modern contracts include unlimited calls and texts, but data needs vary. While unlimited data plans are available through carriers like Vodafone and Three, our bemobiles.com data calculator helps determine your ideal allowance based on streaming, browsing, and app usage patterns.

              <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                Before committing to a 24-month contract, verify your chosen network's signal strength in your area. At bemobiles.com, we provide detailed coverage maps for all major UK networks.

              <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                Balance upfront and monthly payments effectively. Higher initial payments typically reduce monthly costs, while zero-upfront deals offer immediate accessibility with higher monthly installments. At bemobiles.com, we offer transparent pricing across all payment structures.

              <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                Choose between 12-36 month terms. While longer contracts reduce monthly payments, shorter terms often prove more cost-effective overall. Consider your financial flexibility and commitment preferences when selecting your contract length at bemobiles.com.
