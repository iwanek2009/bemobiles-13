      <PageText>
        Comparing different contract deals is crucial, much like how homeowners compare broadband services to find the best plan.

      <PageText variant="h3">Contract Length Matters</PageText>
      <PageText>
        Short-Term Contracts (12 Months): Higher monthly payments but quicker upgrades.
        Long-Term Contracts (24+ Months): Lower monthly costs spread over time, but you're committed to the same provider.

        Monthly Payments: Factor in data usage, additional services (like Apple Music or Apple TV+), and potential price hikes after promotional periods.

          Investigate carrier coverage in your area. A great deal means little if your signal is weak.
